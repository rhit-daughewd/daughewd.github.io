        <p>Hi, I'm WIll Daugherty, a student at Rose Hulman studying software engineering. I plan to work in
            game or web design creating products for personal and professional use.</p>

        <p>In my free time I tend to play video games with friends online or watch movies and tv and some of my favorite recent games are Elden Ring and Baldurs Gate.
            Besides games I have been getting more interested in art and storytelling, I have been trying to improve my skills in desiging characters and telling stories
            because fiction is just cool and having something to call fully your own sounds really interesting. Finally I have recently started playing tabletop rpgs like
            DnD as a way to not only destress but practice my design skills and have fun with friends while I'm at it.</p>

        <p>This website is a portfolio or my current work as well as a test of abilities to create a multi page
            website.</p>
